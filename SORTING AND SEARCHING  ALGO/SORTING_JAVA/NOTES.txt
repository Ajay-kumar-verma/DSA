what to study 

With space compexity (auxiluary space ) ,time complexity

IN details  

Bubble sort (iteraive and recursive) 
Time complexity =n*n 
in best case =n

If no swap means array are sorted 


Selection sort (iterative and recursive way)
worst case =n*n;
best  case =n*n


Insertion sort 
worst case n*n
best case n 


merge and quick sort (divide and conquer technique)
heap sort
count sort 
radix sort
