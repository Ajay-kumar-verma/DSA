Problem Statement:
 

Alice has an array A of size N.

She is very much obsessed with numbers which is a power of two. She wants to count the maximum number of pairs she can make out of these N integers so that the sum of elements in each pair is a power of two. Note that a number A_i can not belong to multiple pairs.

Alice is not good at programming so she asked you to count the maximum number of such pairs.

 

Note:- A number X is said to be a power of two if we can write X = 2^p, where p is a non-negative integer.

 

 

Constraints:

 

1 <= t  <=10^3 
1 <=N <=2*10^5
1 <=A[i] <=10^12
 

 

Input Format:

 

First-line contains a single integer t, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the number of elements in array A.
The second line of each test case contains N positive integers.
The sum of N over all test cases doesn’t exceed 2*10^5
 

 

Output Format:

 

For each test case, output a single line— the maximum number of pairs she can get so that summation of the elements of each pair is a power of two.
 

 

Sample Input:

 

2
5
3 11 16 5 13
4
2 6 14 1

 


Sample Output:

 

2
1

 

 


Explanation of Sample:

 

Test case 1: Here we can make a maximum of two pairs, 
                      (3, 13)---> Summation = 3+13 = 16 = 24
                      (11, 5)---> Summation = 11+5 = 16 = 24


Test case 2: Here we can make a maximum of one pair, 
                      (2, 6)---> Summation = 2+6 = 8 = 23

 

 

 

 

Things to Note for the Candidate:

 

You can use your own IDE like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other IDE that you are comfortable with to build your solution code.
The IDE provided on the platform is purely for submission. Avoid using the IDE for coding out the solution.
Test against any custom input in your own IDE. In the IDE provided on the platform, you cannot pass custom test cases and see the output. 
Use standard input and standard output in your program for the IDE to run the test cases smoothly against your code. We are giving a sample problem statement along with a solution that will pass the test cases in the IDE. - Sample Problem Statement  (Right Click and Open in New Tab to view.)
